🧠 **Business Understanding**

Bukit Vista is a property management and hospitality company that manages various types of accommodations such as villas, guest houses, and vacation rentals across Bali. The company’s mission is to create delightful travel experiences by connecting guests with properties that best match their preferences — whether for comfort, convenience, or beautiful aesthetics.

However, Bukit Vista faces two main challenges:
1. **Understanding & Managing Property Insights (Data Analyst Focus)**
   >
With a growing number of listings, the company needs to identify key trends such as price distribution, guest ratings, location clusters, and property types to make data-driven decisions in marketing, pricing, and property acquisition.

2. **Enhancing Guest Experience Through Visual Discovery (Data Scientist Focus)**
  >

Therefore, this project integrates two complementary approaches:

- **Data Analytics Dashboard**: to provide real-time insights into property performance, distribution, and pricing strategies.

- **Image Mining System (AI Model)**: to recommend properties with similar visual features based on uploaded photos, supporting guests who value aesthetics and memorable experiences.

❓ **Problem Statements**
1. **Data Analyst Perspective**
- Which property types are most dominant in Bukit Vista’s portfolio, and what does this indicate about the target market?
- How are properties distributed across different areas and price ranges in Bali?
- How can these insights support more effective pricing, marketing, and investment decisions?

2. **Data Scientist Perspective**
- How can image mining techniques be used to classify property photos into price categories based on their visual features?
- Can we recommend Bukit Vista properties with similar aesthetics (e.g., ocean views, rice fields, or jungle settings) to match the style of an uploaded photo?
- How can this AI-driven approach enhance guest engagement, especially for tourists looking for scenic stays or photo-worthy locations?
- How can the model’s predictions (price range + visual similarity) integrate with the data analytics dashboard to create a seamless discovery experience?

💡 **Project Objectives**

1. **Data Analytics Goal**:
- Develop an interactive, real-time web dashboard (using tools such as Streamlit or Google Looker Studio) that visualizes property performance metrics, pricing trends, location clusters, and guest insights.

2. **Data Science Goal**:
- Build an image mining model using TensorFlow and Keras that can:
- Predict the price range (Low, Medium, High) of an uploaded property image.
- Recommend visually similar properties from the Bukit Vista dataset based on the image’s features.

Display predicted price range, confidence score, and preview images of the recommended listings.

🚀 Business Impact
- For Guests: Enables an intuitive, image-based way to find scenic stays for vacations or photoshoots — turning visual inspiration into practical booking recommendations.
- For Bukit Vista: Provides actionable insights through analytics and AI to optimize pricing, marketing, and property curation.
- For Management: Strengthens data-driven decision-making and aligns visual appeal with market demand to improve guest satisfaction and revenue growth.
